title: React Templates
---

## Intro
Hi there, Rsbuild is one of the tools that allows create react template projects, among other plethora of features.
You could imagine that there are several options to build react templates projects but when exploring the libraries availables the landscape shows:
* A great amount people use or used created-react-app, which is out of active development, and not recommended, deprecated.
* There is a great project called Vitest which allows to create useful templates, but those aren't their main features.
* My choice? It is Rsbuild.


## Rsbuild
```bash
npx create-rsbuild --template react
```
Or
```bash
pnpm create rsbuild@latest
```
