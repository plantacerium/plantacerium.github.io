[{"title":"AST Grep","content":"Guide to Using AST Grep#\n\n\nIntroduction#\n\nast-grep is a powerful, command-line tool for searching and rewriting code based\non its abstract syntax tree (AST). This allows for more precise and powerful\ncode modifications than traditional text-based search and replace tools.\n\nThis guide provides an overview of ast-grep and how to use it in a production\nenvironment, covering common, real-world, and edge use cases.\n\n\nKey Concepts#\n\n * Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): An AST is a tree representation of the syntactic\n   structure of source code. ast-grep uses ASTs to understand the code's\n   structure, rather than just treating it as plain text.\n\n * Patterns: You can write patterns that look like the code you want to find.\n   These patterns can include wildcards to match different parts of the code.\n\n * Rewriting: ast-grep can rewrite code by replacing the matched patterns with a\n   new code structure.\n\n\nInstallation#\n\nYou can install ast-grep using various package managers:\n\n\nUsing npm#\n\nnpm install -g @ast-grep/cli\n\n\n\nUsing pip#\n\npip install ast-grep-cli\n\n\n\nUsing Homebrew#\n\nbrew install ast-grep\n\n\n\nReal-World Use Cases#\n\nHere are some real-world examples of how ast-grep can be used in a production\nenvironment:\n\n\n1. Large-Scale Refactoring#\n\nWhen a library or API changes, you often need to update your entire codebase.\nast-grep can automate this process.\n\nScenario: You are upgrading a testing library and need to replace the old\nassertion style with a new one.\n\nOld code:\n\nassert.equal(actual, expected);\n\n\nNew code:\n\nexpect(actual).toEqual(expected);\n\n\nast-grep command:\n\nsg -p 'assert.equal($A, $B)' -r 'expect($A).toEqual($B)' -l js\n\n\n\n2. Enforcing Code Standards#\n\nYou can use ast-grep to enforce coding standards and best practices across your\norganization.\n\nScenario: You want to ensure that all fetch calls have a timeout and appropriate\nerror handling.\n\nPattern to find fetch calls without a timeout:\n\n# rules/no-fetch-without-timeout.yml\nid: no-fetch-without-timeout\nlanguage: JavaScript\nrule:\n  pattern: fetch($URL)\n  not:\n    has:\n      pattern: fetch($URL, { timeout: $T })\n\n\nast-grep command to lint:\n\nsg scan -r rules/no-fetch-without-timeout.yml\n\n\n\n3. Security Vulnerability Patching#\n\nast-grep can be used to find and patch security vulnerabilities at scale.\n\nScenario: A security vulnerability is discovered in a commonly used function,\nand you need to replace it with a safer alternative.\n\nVulnerable code:\n\nconst html = unsafeFunction(userInput);\n\n\nPatched code:\n\nconst html = safeFunction(userInput);\n\n\nast-grep command:\n\nsg -p 'unsafeFunction($ARG)' -r 'safeFunction($ARG)' -l js\n\n\n\nCommon Use Cases#\n\nHere are some common use cases for ast-grep:\n\n * API Migration: When a framework or library that you use updates its API, you\n   can use ast-grep to automatically update your code.\n\n * Code Cleanup: Remove deprecated functions, unused variables, and other code\n   smells.\n\n * Boilerplate Generation: Automate the creation of boilerplate code for new\n   components or modules.\n\n\nEdge Use Cases#\n\nHere are some advanced and less-common use cases for ast-grep:\n\n\n1. Analyzing Code for Complex Patterns#\n\nYou can use ast-grep to find complex code patterns that might be difficult to\nexpress with other tools.\n\nScenario: Find all functions that are called with a specific argument and then\nimmediately awaited.\n\nPattern:\n\nsg -p 'await $FN($ARG)' -l js\n\n\n\n2. Multi-language Support#\n\nast-grep is a polyglot tool and it can be used on a variety of different\nprogramming languages.\n\nScenario: Rewrite Python f-strings to use the str.format() method.\n\nast-grep command:\n\nsg -p 'f\"Hello, {$NAME}\"' -r '\"Hello, {}\".format($NAME)' -l py\n\n\n\n3. Custom#\n\nLinting Rules\n\nYou can create your own custom linting rules to enforce project-specific\nconventions.\n\nScenario: Ensure that all database queries are made through a specific helper\nfunction.\n\nPattern to find direct database queries:\n\n# rules/no-direct-db-queries.yml\nid: no-direct-db-queries\nlanguage: Python\nrule:\n  pattern: db.execute($QUERY)\n\n\nast-grep command:\n\nsg scan -r rules/no-direct-db-queries.yml\n\n\n\nConclusion#\n\nast-grep is a versatile and powerful tool that can significantly improve your\nworkflow for code maintenance, refactoring, and analysis. By understanding its\ncore concepts and exploring its various use cases, you can leverage ast-grep to\nwrite cleaner, safer, and more consistent code.","routePath":"/blog-software-engineer/Backend/ast-grep","lang":"","toc":[{"text":"Introduction","id":"introduction","depth":2,"charIndex":26},{"text":"Key Concepts","id":"key-concepts","depth":2,"charIndex":415},{"text":"Installation","id":"installation","depth":2,"charIndex":905},{"text":"Real-World Use Cases","id":"real-world-use-cases","depth":2,"charIndex":1105},{"text":"1.

Think\n   of it as a toolkit that gives your Python code the power to create\n   traditional desktop applications with windows, buttons, and menus. It's like\n   giving a master chef (your Python logic) a professional kitchen (the Qt\n   framework) to work in.\n * Use Case: Creating the simplest possible graphical user interface (GUI).\n * Real-World Scenario: A student or hobbyist wants to move beyond console-based\n   \"Hello, World!\" programs and create an actual clickable window on their\n   screen.\n * Production Example: This level is too simple for production, but it's the\n   foundational step for every complex application. A script that just opens a\n   blank window is the starting point.\n\n\nimport sys  \nfrom PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget\n\n\\# Every PyQt application must create an application object.  \napp \\= QApplication(sys.argv)\n\n\\# The QWidget widget is the base class of all user interface objects.  \nwindow \\= QWidget()  \nwindow.setWindowTitle('My First App')  \nwindow.show() \\# Make the window visible.\n\n\\# Start the event loop.  \nsys.exit(app.exec())\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## Level 2: Adding Widgets and Layouts - Building a Form 📝#\n\n * Concept: Widgets are the building blocks of a GUI—buttons (QPushButton), text\n   boxes (QLineEdit), labels (QLabel), etc. Layouts (QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout,\n   QGridLayout) are invisible containers that automatically arrange your\n   widgets, ensuring the UI looks organized even when the window is resized.\n * Use Case: Creating a simple data entry form.\n * Real-World Scenario: A receptionist needs a very simple tool to enter a\n   visitor's name and company before printing a badge.\n * Production Example: The login screen for an internal company tool. It has\n   labels for \"Username\" and \"Password,\" two text input fields, and a \"Login\"\n   button, all neatly arranged.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## Level 3: Signals & Slots - Making It Interactive 💡#\n\n * Concept: This is the core of Qt's interactivity. When something happens\n   (e.g., a user clicks a button), the widget emits a signal. You connect that\n   signal to a Python function, which is called a slot. This signal -> slot\n   connection is how you make your application do things.\n * Use Case: Connecting UI actions to backend logic.\n * Real-World Scenario: In the data entry form from Level 2, when the \"Submit\"\n   button is clicked (the clicked signal), a function (the slot) is triggered to\n   save the entered name and company to a text file.\n * Production Example: In a video player like VLC (which uses Qt), dragging the\n   volume slider emits a valueChanged signal. This signal is connected to a slot\n   that adjusts the application's audio volume.\n\n\n\\# ... (inside your application class)  \nbutton \\= QPushButton(\"Click Me\")  \n\\# Connect the button's 'clicked' signal to the 'on\\_button\\_click' method (the slot).  \nbutton.clicked.connect(self.on\\_button\\_click)\n\ndef on\\_button\\_click(self):  \n    print(\"Button was clicked\\!\")  \n    QMessageBox.information(self, \"Success\", \"Data has been processed.\")\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## Level 4: Complex UIs & Main Windows - Building an Application 🛠️#\n\n * Concept: Real applications are more than just one form. QMainWindow is a\n   pre-made widget that provides a standard application structure, including a\n   menu bar (QMenuBar), toolbars (QToolBar), and a status bar (QStatusBar). You\n   also start using more advanced widgets like tables (QTableWidget) and tabbed\n   interfaces (QTabWidget).\n * Use Case: Building a simple document editor or data browser.\n * Real-World Scenario: Creating a basic inventory management tool for a small\n   store. It has a menu bar (\"File\", \"Edit\"), a main area with a table showing\n   products, and a status bar at the bottom displaying the total number of\n   items.\n * Production Example: Anki, the popular open-source flashcard program. Its main\n   interface is a QMainWindow that presents decks, a menu bar for syncing and\n   settings, and a central area to review cards.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## Level 5: Qt Designer - Separating Design from Logic 🎨#\n\n * Concept: Writing code to manually position every widget is tedious. Qt\n   Designer is a drag-and-drop tool that lets you visually design your UI and\n   save it as a .ui file. Your Python code then loads this file, instantly\n   creating the interface. This separates the \"look\" (the .ui file) from the\n   \"feel\" (the Python logic).\n * Use Case: Rapidly prototyping and building complex user interfaces.\n * Real-World Scenario: A team of developers is building a settings dialog with\n   dozens of checkboxes, sliders, and input fields organized into tabs. Instead\n   of writing hundreds of lines of UI code, a designer lays it out visually in\n   Qt Designer in a fraction of the time. The developer then just writes the\n   Python code to handle the logic.\n * Production Example: Many engineering and scientific tools use this approach.\n   The UI for controlling a piece of lab equipment might be designed visually,\n   while the Python code handles the complex communication protocols with the\n   hardware.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## Level 6: Styling & Customization - Creating a Brand Identity ✨#\n\n * Concept: Giving your application a unique, professional look. This is done\n   primarily with Qt Style Sheets (QSS), which have a syntax nearly identical to\n   CSS used in web development. For truly unique functionality, you can also\n   create custom widgets by inheriting from existing ones and overriding their\n   drawing or behavior.\n * Use Case: Creating a branded application with a non-standard look (e.g., a\n   dark theme).\n * Real-World Scenario: A music production software company wants its\n   application to have a dark, sleek interface with custom-designed knobs and\n   sliders that look like real studio hardware. They use QSS to define the color\n   scheme and create a custom QDial widget for the knobs.\n * Production Example: Dropbox's desktop client settings panel. It doesn't use\n   the default operating system's look; instead, it uses a custom, clean, and\n   branded style that is consistent across Windows, macOS, and Linux, achieved\n   through styling.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## Level 7: Multithreading - Keeping the UI Responsive 🏃#\n\n * Concept: If you run a long task (like downloading a file or processing a\n   large amount of data) in your main UI code, the entire application will\n   freeze until it's done. The solution is multithreading. PyQt provides a\n   QThread class to move long-running tasks to a separate \"worker\" thread. This\n   worker can send signals back to the main thread to update a progress bar\n   (QProgressBar) or display results without ever freezing the UI.\n * Use Case: Performing any task that takes more than a fraction of a second.\n * Real-World Scenario: A data analysis tool that needs to process a 5GB data\n   file. When the user clicks \"Process,\" a worker thread is started. The main UI\n   remains responsive, showing a progress bar that updates as the worker thread\n   sends progress signals. The user can even click a \"Cancel\" button.\n * Production Example: Calibre, the e-book management software. When converting\n   an e-book from one format to another (a slow process), it does so in a\n   background thread. The main interface remains fully usable, allowing you to\n   browse your library while the conversion job runs in the background.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## Level 8: Advanced Integration - Databases & Networking 🌐#\n\n * Concept: Most real applications need to communicate with the outside world.\n   PyQt has built-in modules like QtSql for connecting to databases (like\n   SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) and QtNetwork for making HTTP requests and\n   building clients/servers. This allows you to create rich, data-driven\n   applications without relying on many external libraries.\n * Use Case: Building a client application for a web service or a local database\n   viewer.\n * Real-World Scenario: A stock monitoring application. It uses QtNetwork to\n   periodically fetch the latest stock prices from a financial API. It then uses\n   QtSql to log this data to a local SQLite database for historical analysis.\n   The data is displayed to the user in a QTableView that is linked directly to\n   the database model.\n * Production Example: Orange Data Mining. This is a powerful visual programming\n   tool for data science. Its entire interface is built with PyQt. Many of its\n   \"widgets\" (visual blocks) are designed to connect to data sources, whether\n   from a local CSV file, a remote URL, or a SQL database, using these exact Qt\n   modules.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## Level 9: Custom Graphics & Visualization - Beyond Standard Widgets 📈#\n\n * Concept: For applications that require more than just buttons and forms, like\n   CAD tools, scientific plotters, or game editors, PyQt offers the Graphics\n   View Framework. It provides a QGraphicsScene (an abstract surface) where you\n   can add thousands of 2D items (QGraphicsItem) and a QGraphicsView to look at\n   the scene. It's highly optimized for complex, interactive 2D graphics.\n * Use Case: Creating node-based editors, scientific visualization tools, or\n   simple 2D drawing applications.\n * Real-World Scenario: A visual effects studio builds an in-house tool for\n   artists to create complex shader graphs. The interface is a QGraphicsView\n   where artists can drag-and-drop nodes (custom QGraphicsItem objects) and\n   connect them with lines to build a material.\n * Production Example: Autodesk Maya, a leading 3D animation software. While its\n   core 3D viewport is a highly specialized C++ component, a huge portion of its\n   surrounding UI, including the node editor, attribute editor, and scripting\n   windows, is built using PyQt (or its C++ equivalent, Qt). This allows for\n   easy customization and scripting by technical artists.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n## Level 10: Cross-Platform Deployment & Professional Distribution 📦#\n\n * Concept: The final step is packaging your Python/PyQt application into a\n   single, standalone executable file (.exe on Windows, .app on macOS) that\n   users can run without installing Python or any libraries. Tools like\n   PyInstaller or cx_Freeze are used to bundle the Python interpreter, your\n   code, and all necessary PyQt libraries into a professional, distributable\n   package.\n * Use Case: Distributing a commercial or open-source desktop application to a\n   non-technical audience.\n * Real-World Scenario: A software company has finished its new photo editing\n   application. They use PyInstaller to create installers for Windows and macOS.\n   When a customer downloads and runs the installer, it places a single\n   application icon in their programs folder, which works just like any other\n   native application.\n * Production Example: A huge number of commercial and scientific applications\n   are deployed this way. Spyder, the Scientific Python Development Environment,\n   is a complex application written in PyQt that is often distributed as a\n   standalone package, bundling all its dependencies for a simple user\n   experience. This showcases PyQt's ability to build and deploy complex,\n   mission-critical applications to a wide audience.","routePath":"/blog-software-engineer/Python/pyqt-real-world-scenarios","lang":"","toc":[{"text":"**## Level 1: The Absolute Basics - Making a Window 🪟**","id":"-level-1-the-absolute-basics---making-a-window-","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"**## Level 2: Adding Widgets and Layouts - Building a Form 📝**","id":"-level-2-adding-widgets-and-layouts---building-a-form-","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"**## Level 3: Signals & Slots - Making It Interactive 💡**","id":"-level-3-signals--slots---making-it-interactive-","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"**## Level 4: Complex UIs & Main Windows - Building an Application 🛠️**","id":"-level-4-complex-uis--main-windows---building-an-application-️","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"**## Level 5: Qt Designer - Separating Design from Logic 🎨**","id":"-level-5-qt-designer---separating-design-from-logic-","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"**## Level 6: Styling & Customization - Creating a Brand Identity ✨**","id":"-level-6-styling--customization---creating-a-brand-identity-","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"**## Level 7: Multithreading - Keeping the UI Responsive 🏃**","id":"-level-7-multithreading---keeping-the-ui-responsive-","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"**## Level 8: Advanced Integration - Databases & Networking 🌐**","id":"-level-8-advanced-integration---databases--networking-","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"**## Level 9: Custom Graphics & Visualization - Beyond Standard Widgets 📈**","id":"-level-9-custom-graphics--visualization---beyond-standard-widgets-","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"**## Level 10: Cross-Platform Deployment & Professional Distribution 📦**","id":"-level-10-cross-platform-deployment--professional-distribution-","depth":3,"charIndex":-1}],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""},{"title":"QT & PyQT5","content":"#\n\nThe Qt application framework is a mature, comprehensive, cross-platform\ndevelopment toolset primarily written in C++ that is used for creating graphical\nuser interfaces (GUIs) as well as non-GUI applications for desktop, mobile,\nembedded, and web platforms.\n\nIt was originally conceived in the 1990s and has since become a leading\nframework known for its write once, deploy everywhere philosophy and its\ncomprehensive set of APIs for everything from graphics and UI to networking,\ndatabases, and threading.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nQt Development with PyQt5: Free to Use#\n\nYou can develop and use the Qt framework for free by leveraging its open-source\nlicensing and the Python bindings provided by PyQt5.\n\nCOMPONENT                     DESCRIPTION                                                    FREE FOR DEVELOPMENT & USE?

Open Source Projects: If your application is distributed under a\n    GPL-compatible open-source license, you can use PyQt5 for free.\n 2. Proprietary/Closed-Source Projects:\n    * Since PyQt5 is licensed under GPL v3, you must purchase a commercial\n      license from Riverbank Computing if you intend to distribute a\n      proprietary, closed-source application.\n    * Alternatively, you can switch to PySide6 (the official Qt for Python\n      bindings from The Qt Company), which is available under the more\n      permissive LGPL v3 license. LGPL generally allows you to use the library\n      in closed-source applications without purchasing a commercial license,\n      provided you adhere to its specific terms (e.g., dynamically linking to\n      the Qt libraries).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nKey Related Qt Products and Tools#\n\nWhile the framework is the foundation, several tools aid the development\nprocess:\n\n\n1. Development Tools#\n\n * Qt Creator: The official IDE for Qt development. It integrates tools like the\n   visual debugger and the build system (qmake or CMake).\n * Qt Designer: A WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) tool for creating .ui\n   files, which are XML-based descriptions of your user interface. PyQt\n   applications can load these files directly or convert them to Python code\n   using the pyuic5 tool.\n * Moc (Meta-Object Compiler): A tool essential for C++ that enables Qt's unique\n   object communication system known as Signals and Slots, though this is\n   handled automatically when using PyQt5 in Python.\n\n\n2. Framework Components (Modules)#\n\nQt is modular, meaning you only include the components you need. The core\ncomponents free to use with PyQt5 include:\n\n * Qt Core: Essential non-GUI classes (threading, file I/O, event system, and\n   the powerful Signals and Slots mechanism).\n * Qt Widgets: The library for traditional desktop applications with a native\n   look and feel.\n * Qt GUI: Base classes for graphical elements, windowing, and OpenGL.\n * Qt Network: Classes for TCP/IP, UDP, and network programming.\n * Qt SQL: Database integration classes.\n * Qt Multimedia: Classes for audio, video, and camera functionality.\n * Qt Quick / QML: A declarative scripting language for rapid development of\n   fluid, animated, touch-enabled user interfaces.\n\n\n3. Cross Platform Compilation#\n\nPyQt5 code can be \"compiled\" (packaged into standalone executables) for a wide\nrange of operating systems, limited primarily by the underlying Qt 5 framework's\ncross-platform support.\n\nThe main platforms it supports are:\n\nCore Desktop Platforms These are the most common and easiest to deploy to using\ntools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze:\n\n * Windows (32-bit and 64-bit Intel/AMD architectures)\n * macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon/ARM architectures)\n * Linux (Various distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, using Intel/AMD and ARM\n   architectures)\n\nMobile and Other Platforms While more complex and often requiring specialized\ntools like pyqtdeploy, PyQt5 (and Qt 5) can also target mobile and embedded\nsystems:\n\n * Android\n * iOS\n * Various embedded systems (like Raspberry Pi, which uses ARM Linux).\n\nEssentially, because PyQt is a binding for the C++ Qt library, it can run on any\nplatform for which the Qt 5 framework itself has been ported. This makes PyQt a\ntruly cross-platform solution for GUI development.\n\nFuentes","routePath":"/blog-software-engineer/Python/pyqt5","lang":"","toc":[{"text":"**Qt Development with PyQt5: Free to Use**","id":"qt-development-with-pyqt5-free-to-use","depth":2,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"**The Critical Licensing Point (GPL vs. LGPL)**","id":"the-critical-licensing-point-gpl-vs-lgpl","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"**Key Related Qt Products and Tools**","id":"key-related-qt-products-and-tools","depth":2,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"**1.
